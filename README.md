# go-utility-ideas

A set of useful Go utilities which could be candidates for pull requests into Go open source repo. For now; a useful repository for my Go inventions and shortcuts

### From the getgo, I want to introduce more elegant formatter options to potentially push to the fmt lib

### There are also some utils standard in other languages/frameworks that Go/Golang severely lacks, may look into these too

# The importance of this repo is to

- Track useful utils I create while learning Go
- Document lacking or non-optimal strategem within Go ecosystem and where improvements can be made
- Highlighting candidates to be hoisted into the Go open source repo if found there is not alternative already built
